Every time you do one of these breathwork routines, you are elevating, you’re expanding, and activating to your super human potential.\n\nEvery time you don’t, you’re sliding backwards. It's inevitable, it happens to me, happens to everyone. Plant this seed in your mind, and just know that this isn’t an option.\n\nIf you are a Jedi, which I know you are, then this Breathwork is a must.\n\nSome days you may have less time - do 3 minutes, if you have more, do 30 minutes. Before you get into this, it's really important that you remember Star Magic is a lifestyle. And that lifestyle comes at a price of discipline, commitment, and focus.";

Through conscious breathing, we prime ourselves for healing by softening the nervous system, awakening cellular memory, and preparing our cells to receive deeper transformation in meditation. Breathwork and meditation work hand in hand: the breath clears and activates, while meditation integrates and recalibrates. This combination resets the nervous system, boosts the lymphatic system, and supercharges the pineal gland."
